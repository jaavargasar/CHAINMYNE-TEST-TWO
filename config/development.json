// When the code is upload to Github or a Git repository, we shouldn't have the keys store in this file. Actually the good programming pattern
// Is to store them inside the .env file ( Which I did), and then just copy those keys from there and paste it here. For simplicity I keep this

// Keys inside this file. So you can not find errors when running the application, but usually they should be empty strings
